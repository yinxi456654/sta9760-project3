# Steaming Finance Data with AWS Lambda
In this project, I created a lambda function to collect one full day's worth of stock High and Low prices for companies on 12/01/2020, and I saved the data into S3 for Athena to query.
There are three major infrastructure elements that involved working with this project, DataTransformer, DataCollector and DataAnalyzer.

## Part I: DataTransformer
In AWS lambda, I created a lambda function with yfinance module. The function retrieves data from yahoo finance.

## Part II: DataCollector
In AWS Kinesis, I created a Kinesis Delivery Stream which is connected to the Lambda function which we created. Transfer all the data into a S3 bucket.

## Part III: Data Analyzer
I configured AWS glue, connecting it to the S3 Bucket that I created in my DataCollector. This allow me to query the S3 file which was generated by Lambda function so I can analyze it with Athena.

## Part III: Data analysis
I ran a query to give us the highest hourly stock "high" for each company we retrived from yahoo finance.
